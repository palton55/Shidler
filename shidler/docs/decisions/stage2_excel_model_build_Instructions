## Stage 2 – Excel Model Build (6 Points)

Goal Using the provided Stage 2 Skeleton template, build a working Excel model that implements your firm's FX hedge analysis. Your model should clearly show how each hedging strategy affects your USD proceeds and risk exposure turning the business problem from your Stage 1 memo into a functioning analytical tool.

Scenario You are the Financial Analyst or Treasury Analyst supporting your CFO.

Your Stage 1 memo defined the problem a foreign currency receivable exposed to exchange rate risk. Now, in Stage 2, you will convert that business scenario into a spreadsheet that computes and compares hedge outcomes side by side. Work from your Stage 1 scenario. If anything is ambiguous interest rate basis, exact option strikes, make a reasonable assumption and note it in your model.

Include in Your Model
1. Inputs Section (Yellow Cells)
- All scenario variables from your Stage 1 memo FC amount, spot rate, forward rate, interest rates, option strikes, premiums, and time horizon.
- Use clear labels, consistent units, and named ranges for key cells FC_AMT, S0_in, F0_in, R_USD, R_FC, K_PUT, K_CALL, PREM_PUT, PREM_CALL, T_DAYS.
- Highlight all editable inputs in yellow.

2. Forward Hedge
- Calculate locked in USD proceeds using the forward rate.
- Show the result clearly in your comparison summary.

3. Money Market Hedge
- Show each sub step explicitly borrow in foreign currency convert at spot invest in USD.
- Confirm parity by comparing your MM result to the forward hedge result they should be very close.

4. Option Hedges Put and Call
- Compute total premium cost in USD.
- Show how USD proceeds vary with different ending spot rates S_T.
- Use this logic as the basis for your sensitivity section.

5. Sensitivity Table ±5% range
- Vary the ending spot rate from 0.95×S0 to 1.05×S0 in 1% increments.
- Calculate USD proceeds for each hedging strategy at every rate.
- Include a chart comparing hedging outcomes across the scenario range.

6. Summary Output Section Gray Cells
- Forward hedge result USD
- Money Market hedge result USD
- Option results across key scenarios
- A placeholder row for your hedge recommendation to be completed in Stage 4

Instructions and Hints
- Start from the Spreadsheet template provided in class and available in Lamaku.
- Use the template to create your own Excel workbook. Work through it section by section rather than all at once.
- Let your Stage 1 memo guide you. Every variable you identified in the memo should appear as a labeled input in your spreadsheet.
- Keep formulas transparent. Use readable cell references or named ranges throughout. Avoid burying logic in deeply nested expressions. Add brief inline comments where the calculation may not be obvious.
- Check reasonableness as you go.
- Forward and MM hedges should produce very similar USD proceeds within rounding.
- Option proceeds should vary logically and continuously with S_T.
- No result should look wildly different without a clear reason.
- Document your assumptions. Add a Notes & Assumptions section or a dedicated tab listing any simplifications you made rate basis, ignoring bid ask spreads, transaction costs.
- Color coding convention

Color Meaning
Yellow Inputs editable variables
Blue Assumptions
Green Formulas intermediate steps
Gray Outputs summary KPIs

- Avoid over engineering. Focus on clarity and auditability over advanced Excel tricks. A model a colleague can audit in five minutes is worth more than one with elaborate macros no one can follow.
- Optional Stretch Goal Add a data table or short macro to automate your sensitivity grid.

Deliverable
- File name lastname-first-stage2-model.xlsx
- Tabs Main model + Notes & Assumptions tab
- Points 6 graded on structure, accuracy, and professional presentation

Where to save Save your .xlsx file to your repository in a dedicated directory, e.g., docs/templates/excel/.

Evaluation Highlights

Criterion Description Points
Structure and Clarity Logical layout, consistent formatting, labeled inputs 2
Accuracy Correct hedge calculations; forward ≈ MM parity holds 2
Sensitivity and Analysis Sensitivity table and chart implemented and readable 1
Professionalism Color coding, named ranges, notes tab, business ready 1

How This Leads to Stage 3

Building the model before writing a formal specification is intentional.

Once you have worked through the actual calculations, you will have first hand knowledge of:
- Which inputs are most sensitive and why
- Where the model logic is straightforward vs. where judgment calls were required
- What you would improve if building the model again from scratch

You will carry all of that experience into Stage 3, where you will write a formal technical specification that documents what you built and articulates a more polished version.

That spec then feeds directly into your Stage 4 final analysis, where you will write a structured AI prompt and deliver an executive ready hedge recommendation.

By completing Stage 2, you bridge the gap between a business problem and a functioning decision tool exactly what financial analysts do before presenting to senior management.
